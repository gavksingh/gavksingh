[![LinkedIn Gaurav Singh](https://img.shields.io/badge/gavksingh-linkedin-yellow?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavksingh).

Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience building production AI agent systems and scalable distributed services. I ship end-to-end, from designing multi-agent orchestration and semantic retrieval platforms to architecting microservices handling 500K+ daily transactions.

Currently: AI Software Engineer at University at Buffalo, building production-grade AI agents using MCP servers and LangGraph that automate enterprise workflows, and semantic search platforms delivering sub-100ms latency across 1,000+ records.

What I build:

→ AI Agents & Agentic Systems
Shipping MCP servers, multi-agent orchestration with LangGraph/LangChain, semantic retrieval (RAG), vector-based memory architectures, and LLM evaluation frameworks. Built Agentic MCP Hub (enterprise MCP server for Jira, Slack, SQL integrations) and AutoFlow MCP (plug-and-play browser automation for AI agents).

→ Full-Stack AI Platforms
Architected AutoRSR, a clinical AI platform with React/TypeScript and API integrations that accelerated feature delivery by 3x. Built X-Voice, a conversational voice AI platform with sub-200ms responsiveness. Engineered HIPAA-compliant RAG systems with semantic caching that cut LLM costs by 30%.

→ Distributed Systems & Reliability
Served as DRI for microservices serving 50K+ daily users at 99.99% uptime. Designed event-driven Kafka pipelines processing 500K+ daily transactions with exactly-once semantics. Built cloud serverless ML pipelines with CI/CD, Kubernetes, and OpenTelemetry monitoring.

Core Stack: Python, TypeScript, Java, C# | MCP, LangGraph, LangChain, RAG, PyTorch | React, Next.js, Spring Boot, .NET, REST/GraphQL | AWS, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, PostgreSQL, Redis

MS in Computer Science from University at Buffalo (3.9 GPA). AWS, Azure AI, and GCP Certified.

Open to Software Engineer, AI/ML Engineer, and Applied AI Engineer roles.
